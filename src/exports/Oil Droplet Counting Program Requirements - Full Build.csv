,Required Functions,"Possible? 1=yes, 0=no",Progress,,"Additional ""Nice to Have"" Functions","Possible? 1=yes, 0=no",Progress
R1,Oil droplets are labeled according to type,1,"60%(Type 1,2,3)",A1,Tool to adjust the parameters the model uses/the sensitivity to identify each oil droplet type,1,100%
R2,Readout of the # of oil droplets for each type is given within the application,1,50%(the number is counted as log information not in the UI),A2,"Readout of confidence interval and any other relevant statistics of the model fitting at each site, that can be saved into the csv file",1,
R3,"Allows us to correct oil droplet identification within each image, for each type",1,"90%(add/delete detected droplets, under testing)",A3,"Information on nearest neighbor distances within each oil droplet type saved into csv file, both average and matrix of distances for each oil droplet",1,
R4,Have user oil droplet ID corrections to be used to better inform/train the model for that oil droplet type,1(the last stage),,A4,"Information on nearest neighbor distances between each oil droplet type saved into csv file, both average and matrix of distances for each oil droplet",1,
R5,Ability to quickly compare brightfield and epifluorescent image overlayed on each other repeatedly,1,100%,A5,Ability to save counted images into a high resolution picture file format for publication,1,
R6,Ability to adjust overlay of brightfield and epifluorescent image for easier T-Type identification,1,100%,A6,Ability to crop or exclude area within images in the app if certain quadrants can't be counted,1,
R7,"Data saved into a csv file, see below for specifics of what to include",1,,A7,,,
R8,"Set of images can be processed in bulk, without additional user input once started",1,,A8,,,
R9,Ability to check individual sites within a bulk set of images,1,,A9,,,
R10,Keyboard shortcuts for many of the commonly used features,1,,A10,,,
